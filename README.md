### Game "Furry collecting coins"


The purpose of the exercise was to write a simple game in Javascript.
Using object oriented programming.
The hero of our game is  Furry, which moves on a 10x10 square board and collects coins. The player controls by the arrows. When the player hits the wall, the game ends.
At any time during the game, the player can see how many coins he has already collected.

Exercise in CodersLab bootcamp.
